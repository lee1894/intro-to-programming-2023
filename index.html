<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Emily Haag</h3> 
<p>
I am originally from a small town in Georgia. I went to the Univeristy of Georgia and obtained a degree in Psychology in 2018.
Immediately after I graduated, I started working at a trucking company as an administrative assistant. 
After a little over 2 years there I decided I wanted to make a career change and applied to become an air traffic control trainee with the FAA in Oklahoma City.
I quickly learned though that that was not the career for me. However, a friend I made in OKC recommended that I look into his old job as a 911 dispatcher with the Washington State Patrol.
I decided to apply and got the job, so I made the move across the country to Tacoma, Washington (where I live currently).
After a few years there I again felt that it was time for a change, so I talked to my friends that live in the area. 
Most of them are in tech and recommended that I give a career in the field a shot. So, here I am!
